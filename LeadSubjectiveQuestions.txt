3. X Education has a period of 2 months every year during which they hire some interns. 
The sales team, in particular, has around 10 interns allotted to them. So during this 
phase, they wish to make the lead conversion more aggressive. So they want almost all 
of the potential leads (i.e. the customers who have been predicted as 1 by the model) to 
be converted and hence, want to make phone calls to as much of such people as 
possible. Suggest a good strategy they should employ at this stage.

Ans: The call should be made if it follows the below condition:
• They are working professional
• They are coming back to website repeatedly
• Their last is through SMS or EMAIL
• They spend a lot of time in the website and this can be done by providing free 
introductory class or sample class to keep the website interesting and increase 
stickiness of the website.

4. Similarly, at times, the company reaches its target for a quarter before the deadline. 
During this time, the company wants the sales team to focus on some new work as well. 
So during this time, the company’s aim is to not make phone calls unless it’s extremely 
necessary, i.e. they want to minimize the rate of useless phone calls. Suggest a strategy 
they should employ at this stage.

Ans: The X Education can opt for automated email and SMS as we have seen through our 
analysis that these two sources is the highest as last activity of the customer. So, this way 
sales team will not be engaged in send unnecessary mails and SMS to the customer. And 
when leads are generated as hot only those calls can be made by the sales team this will 
minimize their sales activity and focus on new work.
